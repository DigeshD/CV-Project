# 🩺 Heart Sound Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **classification of heart sound signals** into two categories:  
✅ **Normal**  
❌ **Abnormal**  

We use **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** for feature extraction and employ machine learning models like **Random Forest Classifier** and **AdaBoost Classifier** to classify heart sounds effectively.
